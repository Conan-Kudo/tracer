  - applications.xml
  - Defines the characteristics for specific applications
  -
  - Just before the application is printed, tracer looks into this file.
  - When some definition matches, tracer examines its type. Daemons can be
  - printed different way than regular applications. Also applications marked
  - as 'static' will not be printed, cause only way how to restart them is reboot.
